/*
The mkProgDir program will populate the given directory with a set of
standard files suitable as a scaffolding for a Go program. The files will
have TODO comments in them describing the areas where you need to make
changes. The intention is to assist the programmer by providing the files
needed for a simple Go program in a consistent way across all their
projects. This will make it easier for multiple programmers to work together.
