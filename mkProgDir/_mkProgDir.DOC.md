# mkProgDir

This will populate a directory with files suitable to form a skeleton program
\(Go by default\)\. There will be TODO comments at various points in the code
describing changes or additions that need to be made to flesh out the program\.

Note that, by default, the generated program will use packages from the param
module rather than the standard library flag package\. This is available from
github\.com/nickwells/param\.mod\. Other modules from the same repository base
are also used\.

The template used to generate the program can be changed or replaced with
another template directory\.

## Parameters

This uses the `param` package and so it has access to the help parameters
which give a comprehensive message describing the usage of the program and
the parameters you can give. The `-help` parameter on its own will print the
standard parameters that the program can accept but you can also give
parameters to show both more or less help, in more or less detail. Other
standard parameters allow you to explore where parameters have been set and
where they can be set. The description of the `-help` parameter is a good
place to start to explore the help available.

The intention of the `param` package is to provide complete documentation
for the program from the command line.

program version.
